# Space Trail
The year is 2148, 300 years after pioneers conquered the Old West. SOL-3 (formerly known as Earth) has been overcrowded for years, and SOL-4 (formerly known as Mars) is on its way toward filling up as well. It's only been half a century since we made contact with the other races of the galaxy, but since then, humanity has developed Faster-Than-Light travel (with a tiny bit of help from the scientists of LUH-17). Now it's time for the New Frontier (though not quite the Final Frontier).

You and your family are planning a mission to help colonize THX-11. The earliest forerunners have already arrived, and it's time for the second wave of colonists. The path is dangerous, however. Will you and your family make it to THX-11 alive?

# About the Creators
Space Trail is the result of an 8-week collaboration between designers Katie Noborikawa and Amber Slovick. Katie and Amber are both big fans of science fiction books, movies, and shows, so it's no wonder they chose to make a game about space. Besides sci-fi, the other major inspiration for Space Trail was, of course, The Oregon Trail.
