# Alpha Release
## Stardate 2017.12.12
Usually I dread group projects, but this project went better than I expected. We started with the idea of "Oregon Trail, but in space" and went from there. I researched the various versions of Oregon Trail and mapped out ideas based on the basic framework of those games. Once I had an outline put together, Katie used that to start the game.

Katie handled most of the Javascript and images, although I created the icons for food, rations, etc. She also came up with the initial style of the game. I worked on all the non-game pages, game lore/descriptions, and helped with the game's layout and style. I also tested the game several times at various stages of development to find bugs, which I promptly reported to Katie so she could squash them.

Some ideas didn't make it into the alpha release, like the possibility of the ship imploding from traveling at high speeds for too long, or an Asteroids mini-game where you get to shoot asteroids to mine fuel. I also originally wanted there to be more locations. The main reason these didn't make it into the alpha version was because of the looming deadline, and we wanted to focus on making a functional minimum viable product. Now that we've passed the deadline, we have a bit more freedom to expand the game and add more features.

### Future Plans/Ideas
- Add text color to certain items to make them stand out in text console
- Asteroids mini-game (gives ammo a second purpose)
- Structural intergrity mechanic affected by speed of ship (to discourage players from always picking the fastest speed)
- Add more locations and/or lengthen the time between locations
- Animation/video to pique players' interest
- Either make the starting month affect something, or remove it as an option
- Different player icons based on starting profession
- Load images in the background before they're shown to the player
