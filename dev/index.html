			<p>The year is 2148, 300 years after pioneers conquered the Old West. SOL-3 (formerly known as Earth) has been overcrowded for years, and SOL-4 (formerly known as Mars) is on its way toward filling up as well. It's only been half a century since we made contact with the other races of the galaxy, but since then, humanity has developed Faster-Than-Light travel (with a tiny bit of help from the scientists of LUH-17). Now it's time for the New Frontier (though not quite the Final Frontier).</p>
			<p>You and your family are planning a mission to help colonize THX-11. The earliest forerunners have already arrived, and it's time for the second wave of colonists. The path is dangerous, however. Will you and your family make it to THX-11 alive?</p>
